# helptech.com-v0.1

Hi guys,

I have made a website that will help people struggling with tech problems,
my team will be with them, talking about the team, my team is really kind
and will be kind to you as well! Just download the file from releases or
go to code section and then just select "Download ZIP" and then extract
then go to home folder and then run the index.html file! Make sure to
read every single thing before taking an action, actions like joining the
discord server for creating ticket for help, or against the website!

Thanks,
Bye!
